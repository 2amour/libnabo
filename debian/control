Description: A fast K Nearset Neighbor library for low-dimensional spaces.
 libnabo is a fast K Nearest Neighbour library for low-dimensional spaces.
 It provides a clean, legacy-free, scalar-type–agnostic API thanks to C++ 
 templates. Its current CPU implementation is strongly inspired by ANN, 
 but with more compact data types. On the average, libnabo is 5% to 20% 
 faster than ANN.
